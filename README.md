## 🌠 Mission Inspiration

This project was born from a simple question:  
**What if anyone could explore alien worlds without needing a telescope or a PhD in astrophysics?**

With Exoplanet Explorer, I wanted to build a tool that is:
- **Scientific but playful**
- **Informative yet interactive**
- **Capable of sparking curiosity — just like space always does for me.**

## 🎯 Primary Objectives

- Retrieve **planetary intelligence** directly from NASA databases.
- Classify celestial bodies with a **custom Earth Similarity Index (ESI)**.
- Provide **interactive system filters** and **orbital discovery trends**.
- Enable **head-to-head planetary comparison** for research or fun.

## 🛸 Hidden Secrets

- There’s a **1 in 200 chance** that the *Planet of the Day* is actually **Pluto** —  
  _(Yes, I know it’s not officially a planet. Fight me.)_
  
- If you ever stumble upon **Kepler-438b**, you automatically earn **honorary Exoplanet Citizenship**.
